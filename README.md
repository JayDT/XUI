## XUI (Extensible User Interface)
###  (with Xaml and Reflection) Developer preview (unstable)

XUI is a WPF like Framework written in native C++.

It is derived from 3 standalone projects (AvaloniaUI, OmniXaml and Austin Brunkhorst's CPP-Reflection).

This is a hobby project, and the final goal of it is to become fully featured 100% native C++ WPF and Xaml like user interface.
This project has several bugs and missing feature.
